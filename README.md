###_Made my first portfolio for the bootcamp im currently inrolled to_###


## Description
This portfolios tab name is swag because my portfolio is exactly that. Here i placed fake temporary projects with the inspiration of apps i use on a daily basis. The links will direct you to some of my favorite things, check them out! You will also find an imgae i used through AI of a women eating mac and cheese in place of me. The image is true to who i am.
 Some of the fake projects include an app that allows you to take pictures and apply filters. The second allwos you to search for new restaurants like yelp, and finally PJam lets you stream music, or in other words, jam.

## known bugs
The contact section will allow you to click almost anywhere to launch the applications.
